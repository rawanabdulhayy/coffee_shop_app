##Why your `ListView` doesn’t show?

Flutter lays out widgets in **two passes**:

1. **Parent → Child:** The parent tells the child how much space it *can* have (constraints).
2. **Child → Parent:** The child tells the parent how much space it *wants* (size).

Now here’s the catch:

* **`ListView` wants infinite space** in its scrolling direction because it’s meant to scroll through unlimited items.
* If you put it inside a `Column` or a `Padding` **without constraints**, it will try to expand forever, which Flutter won’t allow — so it throws an invisible layout error and renders nothing.

---

### **Your case**

```dart
Padding(
  child: ListView(
    children: [...]
  )
)
```

* `Padding` simply passes constraints down without limiting them.
* If this is inside a `Column`, the `Column` says to the `ListView`:

  > "You can have as much vertical height as you want"
* `ListView` says:

  > "Cool, I’ll take infinite height so I can scroll"
* Flutter:
  ❌ "Nope, infinite height inside another scrollable or unconstrained widget is not allowed."

Result → It doesn’t render.

---

## **How to fix**

You need to give `ListView` **a finite height** in its scroll direction:

* Wrap in `Expanded` → takes the remaining space.
* Wrap in `SizedBox(height: 100)` → fixed height.
* Or make it `scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal` → then it only needs a finite width, which it already has from the screen.

💡 **Rule of thumb:**

> Any scrollable (ListView, SingleChildScrollView, GridView) inside another unbounded parent **must** be given explicit constraints in its scrolling direction, or it will fail.
